Hello!

For the first mini exercise we will focus on something fun. Attached to this readme are 3 videos of some ball animations I would like you to create. The first video is here to teach you some basic way of working with animation. The second will try to show something a bit more complicated. And the third is an "extra" challenge to show how can we push things forward with web animations.

Have fun!
