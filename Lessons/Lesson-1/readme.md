Hello!

This is our first ever exercise together, I hope my personal story will help
inspire you. Being a junior or even a beginners in the field of development is hard. There is so much you feel you don't know, there are endless questions and struggles and its easy to find your self spend 5 hours on something you later feel was obvious. 

We've all been there, its hard, but if you find passion in solving those problems, or if you just feel this is the right thing for you I promise you its possible you can do it. 7 years ago I started learning web development on my own with guidance from a friend. I didn't know anything when I started but I tried and studied every day and learned more and more and within 4 months landed my first job as a junior developer I since made it into a career.

On my first interview I failed miserably I was completely under qualified, so after the rejection I asked them why did they call me if it was so obvious that I'm under qualified. The said that my online CV I sent which I built on my own grab there eye. This came up in all of my interviews back then. So our first exercise will focus on starting your personal CV.

I found this personal web developer CV website and I liked it https://mattfarley.ca/ Your first exercise will be to mimic this. As a beginner you should focus on coding, the content doesn't matter that much its the practice and the repetition that will teach you, one great way of practicing and learning is copying things you like. 

Requirements:
1. Build the home page of the linked website from the top of the page until My Startup Projects (don't include that section). In addition build the purple footer section (don't include the start a project popup).
2. Use only HTML and CSS, use the same assets as the original website and the same content, this is not about building your website, its about learning to build something new.
3. Details are important, make sure you aren't missing the hover effects, the different cursor interactions, if a link opens in a new tab add that as well. 
4. Try to follow best practices, then will be an important thing to pay attention as we move forward, best practices are crucial in development and are here to help us solve problems in the optimal way by people that already solved them. For this exercise try to use things like semantic HTML, correctly structuring CSS code (use classes and not id's, give class name the describe there purpose, reuse class and styles when possible and more).
5. Pay attention and write for your self, what were the hard parts, what were the easy parts, what did you like and what didn't you like, which solutions you think were good which solutions you think were bad, critic and praise your self.
6. always ask questions Google is your friend always check if you are stuck or have an idea but don't know if its possible, our imagination is the best tool we have use it. Also ask me questions Google won't always solve your problems like you would use your colleagues in the office use me for this exercise.
7. Good luck and have fun!
