Hello!

For the second exercise we are going to focus on complicated modern web app dashboard UI. The idea of this exercise is to learn how to organize the structure of a web app page. shared components like header and navigation bar, main section for the app to live in and more.

Please build the following design (sketch file sent), focus on building responsive structure that behaves correctly in all sizes, don't focus on making things pixel perfect. Once the structure is build and working as expected continue to designing each of the inner blocks. At first focus on the content and for the complicated tables you can use images. Later once your done and looking for more challenge, try building the tables and other data visualization items with HTML and CSS.

Good luck!
