    <h3>Welcome to exercise three</h3>
    <p>In this exercise you are going to make your charecter from previous exercise fight monsters and maybe dragons!</p>
    <p>You have 4 different monsters with different ability, every time you call the battle function you should random one of the enemies and fight it</p>
    <p>If you win you gain experience, if you lose its fine we won't do anything about it right now</p>
    <p>each monster has its attack value when it attack it has 4 types of attacks, if it hit it will do the number of its attack, if it miss it does 0, if it crit it does double the attack and if dodge it does half the damage of attack</p>
    <p>each monster has a defense number, when you attack it you should decrease this number from your damage to the monster.</p>
    <p>each time a monster attacks you should randomize the type of attack it does from its own attackTypes array and check how much damage it did</p>
    <p>At the end if you won make sure you add the experience to the charecter experience</p>
    <p>as a starting attempt have each fight be between one of your charecters and one monster randomize both, once you feel its done you can try to do a group against a monster of few monsters vs a group</p>
    <p>In order to decide the amount of damage your charecters does you should take its strength and do 25% of that in damage (round up), if the charecter is a wizard or a celric you should use intelligence instead.
      To decide your charecter defense you should take 10% of you dexterity and round that up.
