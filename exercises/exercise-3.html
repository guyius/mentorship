    <h3>Welcome to exercise three</h3>
    <p>In this exercise you are going to create a dungeons and dragons character</p>
    <p>A dungeons and dragons character needs a name, class and a set of six different abilities.</p>
    <p>First the function will accept a character name and class passed as string</p>
    <p>then you will need to generate the character six different abilities: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma</p>
    <p>For each of this abilities you need to throw a dice (with values between 1-6) 4 times, you then remove the lowest number, and return the sum of the rest as the ability value</p>
    <p>For example: 
      5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.
      3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.
      1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.
      2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.
      3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.
      6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.
    </p>
    <p>Last you need to return the character HP to do so you start with the number 10 and add your character constitution divide it by 2 (round the number up so 2.5 becomes 3) and </p>
    <p>For example above your constitution is 3 so you take 10 + (3 / 2 = 1.5 => round up = 2) so 10 + 2 = 12</p>
